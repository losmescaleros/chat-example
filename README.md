# Simple Chat Using Node.js and Socket.io

The basis for this application really comes from [Socket.io's example chat application](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/), but I've also added some of the 'homework' features listed there. Some features include: 

- User connect/disconnect messages
- Nickname support
- Appending messages directly from source
- User typing indication 
- Showing online users


My goal is to also add persistence using either MongoDb or Redis (preferably Redis).
